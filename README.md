**Use cases:**
- Draft oral scripts for technical interviews
- Create 60-second hooks and deep-dive narratives
- Prepare defensive Q&A for technical challenges
- Generate interview prep materials from resume bullets or whitepapers
- Structure STAR-Plus narratives with trade-off analysis

**Key features:**
- 60-second hook structure
- STAR-Plus deep-dive expansion
- Defensive Q&A preparation (trade-offs, fundamentals, reflection)
- Mock interview simulation (3-round)
- Business impact tie-in for every technical detail
- Interview-friendly language refinement

---

### 5. **Project Whitepaper** (`project-whitepaper/`)
Generates comprehensive technical whitepapers documenting full project architecture, decisions, and implementations.

**Use cases:**
- Create full project-level technical documentation
- Document architecture decisions with ADR tables
- Build technical asset documentation
- Generate in-depth project experience reports
- Document case studies and post-mortems
- Compile knowledge base snippets

**Key features:**
- STAR-Plus framework integration
- Mermaid architecture diagrams
- ADR (Architecture Decision Record) tables
- Core feature implementation details
- Deep-dive case study sections
- Post-mortem and incident documentation
- Knowledge base snippets with code examples
- Baseline compliance validation

---

### 6. **Spec Doc Writer** (`spec-doc-writer/`)
Structures and maintains specification documents following repository conventions with implementation planning and status tracking.

**Use cases:**
- Create spec documentation for tasks (`docs/specs/<task>/`)
- Break down tasks into manageable specifications
- Maintain implementation plans with status tracking
- Generate spec indices and cross-references
- Validate spec completion and status

**Key features:**
- README.md generation with task indices
- `implementation-plan.json` with atomic task tracking
- Modular `spec-*.md` files (max 150 lines each)
- Bidirectional `@see` references (docs ↔ code)
- Status tracking (initial: failed → completion path)
- Template-based documentation
- Atomic commit validation

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a skill** based on your documentation need
2. **Read the skill's SKILL.md** for quick start and workflow
3. **Review the references/** folder for detailed rules and templates
4. **Follow the input checklists** to gather required information
5. **Use the workflow steps** to generate output
6. **Validate against quality gates** before finalizing

## Key Principles

- **Evidence-Based**: All technical claims must be traceable to sources
- **Comprehensive**: Supports full documentation lifecycle from raw notes to interview narratives
- **Modular**: Each skill solves a specific documentation problem
- **Reusable**: Skills build on shared baselines (project-experience-baseline)
- **Structured**: Templates and checklists ensure consistency
- **Bilingual**: English documentation with Chinese skill descriptions

## Language Notes

- Most skill definitions and instructions are in **Chinese**
- Reference documents vary by skill
- Output language is typically matched to the input or explicitly specified
